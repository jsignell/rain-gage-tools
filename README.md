# rain-gage-tools

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive set of tools for reading, quality checking, and analyzing data from rain gage 
networks. The emphasis is on quickly generating, interactve plots that speed up data processing and reduce duplication of effort for 
each new dataset. Of special interest is the intercomparison of computed radar rainfall and gage rainfall. 

These tools are being developed by the Hydrometeorology Group in the Civil Environmental Engineering Department at Princeton University 
(<http://hydrometeorology.princeton.edu/>)
